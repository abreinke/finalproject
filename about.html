    <h1>RAIN DANCE</h1>
    <h1>Project Description</h1>
  <p>"RAIN DANCE" is a project which is meant to help people overcome their fear of thunderstorms, so they can embrace these natural phenomena. I was inspired to create this storm generator since I had a childhood fear of thunderstorms.  Even though I grew out of this fear, I hope this project will help people overcome similar phobias.</p></body></html>
